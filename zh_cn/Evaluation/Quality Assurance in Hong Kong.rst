**3.1 INTRODUCTION**


Responses to increasing public accountability and the expectations of
continuous improvement have served as two of the major impetuses for
evaluating quality in higher education in recent years, with a growing
focus on the assessment of student learning outcomes (Gaston, 2014).
Such a shift toward student learning centrality appears in the Criteria
for Accreditation used in U.S. institutional accreditation (Ewell, 2006a;
Gaston, 2014; HLC/NCA, 2010), in the Standards of Evaluation for
undergraduate teaching endorsed by the Ministry of Education, China,
and in the quality audit conducted by the Quality Assurance Council
(QAC) of the University Grants Council (UGC) for all UGC-funded
institutions in Hong Kong (QAC Audit, 2008). In each quality assurance
approach, the student learning–centered emphasis is articulated to a
different extent in the respective evaluation standards, providing
guidance for how institutions are evaluated in this aspect. These
varying descriptions of learning centrality reflect cultural influences
and other contextual variables in which education is rooted. The
criteria and standards therefore affect higher education in two main
ways: they prompt a reexamination of the quality of education in terms
of student learning outcomes demonstrated in performance (i.e., what
students can do with what they have learned), and they encourage
institutional improvement in effectiveness, as reflected in curricular
reemphasis on student learning (Ewell, 2006a).


A case analysis of the recent transformation (“3+3+4”) in the higher
education sector in Hong Kong is provided to support suggestions on how
to meet challenges that arise in QA practices related to college
curriculum design and implementation.

**3.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE IN THE SPECIAL**

ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (SAR) OF HONG KONG
As a Special Administrative Region of mainland China, Hong Kong enjoys a
high degree of autonomy in governmental responsibilities for many
areas. In the 2014–2015 academic year there were eight UGC-funded
institutions of higher education with a total enrollment of 97,585
students (including 6,076 enrolled in subdegree programs and 10,593 in
post-graduate programs) (Statistics of HK higher education, 2015). In
addition to the eight UGC-funded institutions, there are nine private
higher-education institutions and some 19 other higher-education
providers (public and subdegree, not holding university status).

Quality assurance in Hong Kong can be broadly described as two domains:
institutional QA and programmatic QA. Institutional QA is provided by
bodies such as the Quality Assurance Council (QAC), which oversees the
eight UGC-funded institutions, while the Hong Kong Council for
Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications (HKCAAVQ)
serves private and vocational institutions. The Hong Kong Institution of
Engineers (HKIE), a signatory of the Washington Accord, provides
programmatic accreditation for engineering programs.
The Quality Framework in Hong Kong is described as “a seven-level
hierarchy of qualifications covering the academic, vocational and
continuing education in Hong Kong.” The framework is broadly
comparable to qualifications frameworks in other countries, with levels
five to seven covering first and higher degrees. QA practice in the
higher-education sector in Hong Kong has historical ties with the
United Kingdom’s higher-education system; the current QA infrastructure,
concepts, and practices bear similarities to those used in the UK.

The generic QA system follows a hierarchical structure with framework
and processes at both institutional and program levels (QAC Audit
Manual, 2014), summarized in the following table:

===========  ================================  ==================================
            Structure                         Processes
===========  ================================  ==================================

             - Program Advisory                - Annual Business Plans
               Committee                       - Course Review & Annual

                                               - Program Reviews & Reports

Institution  - Institutional Assessment        - Annual QA Reports
             - Institutional Academic          - Annual Business Plans
               Advisor System                  - Guidelines and Regulations
                                                 for Program Planning,
                                                 Validation and Management
===========  ================================  ==================================


QA bodies in the form of committees are found at both institutional and
program levels; they oversee all QA-related issues. Subject and program
matters are discussed and acted upon through program-level QA bodies,
with program issues examined first at that level before proceeding
through institutional QA processes for final decision making. The QA
processes follow the same flow: subject-level QA information is sent to
the program, and program-level QA information is reported to the
institution for oversight and action.

With these generic QA systems in place, academic-related issues have a
clear channel for discussion, clarification, and decision making. The
QA mechanisms, articulated in QA handbooks, ensure that processes and
procedures are observed and that departments provide oversight of their
activities, acknowledging inter-relationships, ongoing external input,
and departmental responsibility for setting objectives and assessing
progress. An important purpose of QA is to support quality improvement:
continuous improvement at the department level is promoted through the
Annual QA Report and Annual Business Plan exercises. The Annual QA
Report provides detailed information and a self-evaluation of the
department’s performance during the year, while the Business Plan
outlines the department’s strategy for the foreseeable future. The
Departmental Assessment exercise provides a longer-term review and
assessment of the department’s performance against its mission and
strategic objectives in light of changing community, regional, and
global needs.

**3.3 EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE INITIATIVES**

The eight UGC-funded institutions of higher education receive
periodical quality reviews from the UGC and, later, from the Quality
Assurance Council (QAC), established in 2007 and responsible for
conducting quality audits on all UGC-funded institutions. Historically,
these review exercises have included milestones such as the Teaching
and Learning Quality Process Reviews (TLQPRs) in 1995–97 and in
2002–03, and the Performance and Role-related Funding Scheme (PRFS)
in 2004, all conducted by the UGC. Each round focuses on different
themes, evaluating the health of higher education and providing
valuable information for the QAC’s subsequent review processes
(Ewell, 2006b).

**3.4 THE 3+3+4 TRANSFORMATION AND OBA**

A milestone development in QA occurred in 2003 when the UGC asked its
funded institutions to consider outcomes-based approaches (OBA) to
teaching and learning as part of the 3+3+4 transformation of the
educational matriculation (three years junior, three years senior
secondary, and four years undergraduate study). To facilitate this
change, the QAC incorporated assessment of OBA implementation into its
Quality Audit as an important component to examine:

… whether an institution has quality assurance processes in place
appropriate for its stated purposes, whether it pursues activities and
applies resources to achieve those purposes, and whether there is
verifiable evidence to show that the purposes are being achieved. The
QAC’s Audit Manual sets out how the QAC conducts audits and what it
expects to receive from institutions” (QAC Audit Manual, 2008, p. 21).

During 2004–2008, all eight UGC-funded institutions invested manpower
and energy in revising their curricula within the OBA framework,
focusing on the shift from teaching to student learning. The QAC’s
institutional audits made clear that student learning quality is
central, embedding it in several of the eleven Focus Areas for the
audit. Those Focus Areas examine processes and infrastructure in terms
of how “the institution’s practices in each focus area contribute to
student learning outcomes” (QAC Audit Manual, 2008, p. 48). Beyond the
institution’s own evidence, audits expect external reference points and
outcome measures to provide “added assurance that the outcomes have
been specified and measured appropriately” (QAC Audit Manual, 2008, p.
54).

**3.5 APPROACHES TO AUDIT IN HONG KONG**

An audit in the Hong Kong context examines how well students achieve
intended learning outcomes defined by each institution and its
programs. Responsibility for defining student learning rests with the
institution, which must provide evidence of students’ achievement. The
audit’s assessment methodology is similar across institutions but
differs in substance. Course-based evaluation still comprises a major
portion of student-learning evidence, with course grades constituting a
large share of outcome measures. At program and institutional levels,
use of diverse assessment methods remains sporadic, partly because Hong
Kong institutions have stringent internal QA systems—often called the
Department Assessor (DA)—that require internal and external checks on
course-level evaluation design and results. These checks assure the
quality of course-based examinations and tests, which remain the
dominant course-evaluation mechanism. Use of external assessment tools
is not yet systemized, although programs with external accreditation
tend to rely more on such activities. The audit process critically
examines internal QA structures, their effectiveness, and applies
horizontal and vertical sampling to evaluate institutional quality.

As the term “audit” suggests, the process displays characteristics of
audit-based verification against a set of standards. The QAC’s Overview
states that “the purpose of the Audit is to allow the panel to test the
material presented by the institution through first-hand investigation
and personal interactions.” (QAC Audit Manual, 2008, p. 32). Visit
logistics reflect this: interviews and meetings with various
(pre-requested) groups typify the primary site activities. The Audit
Timetable engages an institution nine months prior to the site visit,
with follow-up activities between the institution and QAC extending
for the next 22 months. Institutional involvement in audit preparation
is typically limited to a core group with direct supervisory
responsibilities. Institutions commonly form a special committee that
directs preparation (information gathering, internal meetings, and
drafting the institutional submission). Campus-wide engagement is
relatively limited. To conduct audits, QAC forms panels drawn from its
Register of Auditors, including members from inside and outside Hong
Kong who have undertaken training; panel members are often senior
administrators, sometimes include overseas members, and normally do not
include faculty.

**3.6 IMPACTS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ON THE ACADEMIA**

Higher-education institutions aim to enhance their educational services
and management effectiveness through quality assurance. The adoption of
QA approaches affects the academic community: while intended impacts
can benefit institutions, they can also pose challenges. The analysis
below examines QA criteria in practice in Hong Kong to consider what
educational quality is expected and how it is assessed.

**3.7 COMMONLY ACCEPTED EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES AS EXPECTED IN QA CRITERIA**

For the QAC Institutional Audit in Hong Kong, the QA criteria play a
crucial role. They guide audit procedures for Audit Panel members and
strongly influence how participating institutions prepare their QA
reports (institutional submissions), sometimes prompting substantial
changes in academic practice. Key features in the QA criteria manifest
in three aspects: (1) articulation of expectations for student learning
outcomes; (2) expectations of continuous improvement from
institutions; and (3) implementation of evaluation processes.

**3.8 A FOCUS ON STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES**

In Hong Kong, QA has existed for some time, but recent changes have made
student-learning outcomes a central focus. The adoption of OBA in
curriculum redesign across the eight UGC-funded institutions (2006,
during 3+3+4 changes) demonstrates a desire to enhance educational
quality. The first round of institutional audit (2007–11) emphasized
assessing students’ achievement of articulated learning outcomes. The
language commonly used to describe student learning centers on student
performance, competence, and abilities, as illustrated by achievement
of those outcomes.

**3.9 EXPECTATION OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

In the first round of institutional audits, expectations for improvement
were articulated across all eleven Focus Areas. Institutions were asked
how their existing processes lead to improvement, how evidence from
student-learning assessments informed improvement plans, and how
resources were allocated to support improvement. Institutions were
required to report progress on recommendations. In the second round
(2012–15), quality enhancement became a focal concern:
… defined in terms of institutional policies, procedures, and activities
that are designed to promote the learning experience and learning
outcomes of students and also contribute to the enrichment of the
curriculum (QAC Audit Manual, 2014, p. 8).

The two rounds of audits conducted by QAC had specific focus areas.
The first round ensured that the following were in place in
institutions:

… effective quality assurance systems for the maintenance of
provision at the level of programs and faculties, and institutional
oversight of the academic standards of higher-education qualifications.
The next cycle offers the opportunity to build on this established
base to take forward priorities for quality enhancement and sector-
wide development” (QAC Audit Manual, 2014, p. 12).

**3.10    EVALUATION PROCESSES**

Among the components of evaluation are the self-study process and the
on-site visit. Completing the self-study allows an institution to engage
community members, faculty, administrative staff, and students to
critically examine systems, policies, processes, procedures, and
results against QA standards and criteria. These reflections are
summarized into a document—called a “self-study” in U.S. accreditation,
a “self-evaluation report” in China, and an “institutional submission”
in the Hong Kong audit—that is submitted as supporting evidence.
When the three elements of QA are summarized, they point to a common
theme: student learning as the core operational focus provides an
impetus for institutional continuous improvement, and verification of
outcomes is needed to assure stakeholders of the validity of QA
processes.

**3.11    CULTURALLY-IMPACTED QA CRITERIA**

Each quality assurance approach is deeply embedded in the culture that
nurtures, impacts, and is served by the educational system (Sun,
2011b). Hofstede’s (2001) six dimensions for analyzing national
cultures suggest several dimensions—such as Power Distance, Uncertainty
Avoidance, Aggressiveness, and Collectivism—are closely associated with
characteristics unique to educational practice and behavior in Hong
Kong. Inevitably, differences arise across QA approaches, making each
approach unique in its context and application.

**3.12    QUALITY OF STUDENT LEARNING DEFINED: HONG KONG**

In a recent UGC report (UGC, 2010), three elements were identified to
enhance higher education in Hong Kong: effective utilization of limited
resources for quality education services; competition with international
peers amid globalization; and maintaining relevance in quality
assurance for Hong Kong higher education.
Hong Kong has made substantial progress in higher education. Learning
from QA models in the UK and Australia, Hong Kong has developed its
own tailored QA model. The most direct impetus for the QAC Audit was
“the expansion of the post-secondary sector” (QAC Audit Manual, 2008,
p. 5), with UGC-funded institutions “playing an increasingly active role
in the provision of higher-education opportunities” (QAC Audit Manual,
2008, p. 5). As in many countries, education is a public good, and the
public increasingly shows interest in program quality. The shift to a
3+3+4 structure provided a suitable platform for the current audit
process.

The audit model also displays cultural impact in Hong Kong. Two areas
stand out: seniority influences who is involved in QA processes, and
hierarchical authority affects the degree of participation and
contribution on campus. Hong Kong’s local tradition mixes Chinese and
other cultural influences, and seniority holds significant sway in
academic life. Because the audit model emphasizes performance against
standards, seniority often limits the pool of individuals directly
involved in QA processes. Strong internal QA systems, while beneficial,
can reinforce authoritative divisions of responsibility that shape how
members perform.


**3.13 QA OUTREACH AND ITS IMPACT**

Hong Kong has a long history of QA outreach with international peer
bodies. Examples include the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE),
a signatory of the Washington Accord, and the Hong Kong Council for
Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications (HKCAAVQ), a
founding member of the International Network for Quality Assurance
Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE) and the Asia–Pacific Quality
Network (APQN). QA outreach at the international level takes two main
forms: (1) government-initiated collaboration with QA organizations in
other countries and international bodies; and (2) institutional
participation seeking specialized accreditation.
Those outreach efforts provide platforms for QA organizations to (1)
share best practices with peer professionals and enhance recognition of
Hong Kong QA practices; (2) gain first-hand accreditation experience and
align their work with recognized benchmarks; and (3) improve local QA
practices.

**3.14 MODIFICATION IN OBA: A CASE ANALYSIS**

Continuous improvement characterizes current QA practices in higher
education, aiming to enhance services as a public good and to uphold
academic integrity. The following discussion considers how OBA, as an
approach to curriculum design, may be modified for improvement.

An outcomes-based approach (OBA) expects a clear articulation of
learning outcomes against which student learning is assessed. However,
educators face two challenges: many higher-order knowledge and skills
(HO-KSs) defined in Bloom’s taxonomy are difficult to articulate as
concrete outcomes, and such intangible outcomes complicate assessment
design (e.g., what constitutes an acceptable outcome for “lifelong
learning”?). The proposed modification retains constructive alignment
while adjusting execution during curriculum design to focus on: (1)
articulation of tangibility for HO-KSs; (2) provision of student-centered
and activity-oriented learning platforms; and (3) learning-based
assessment design. This quasi-OBA framework aims to enhance the
implementation of the OBA approach (Sun, 2011a, 2011b).

**3.15 A QUASI-OBA MODEL**

Academic curricula normally consist of two broad categories: disciplinary
knowledge and skills, and meta-knowledge and meta-skills. The latter
category tends to include more HO-KSs. College education emphasizes
both: students must master disciplinary facts, rules, and procedures and
develop ways of thinking about the world (Gregg & Underwood-Gregg,
2011). The meta-knowledge and meta-skills pose conceptual challenges
(articulating expectations as educational outcomes) and technical
challenges (teaching and assessing them). These outcomes often outnumber
disciplinary outcomes in program intended-learning outcomes (Sun,
2010, 2011a).

In an OBA-based curriculum design, intended learning outcomes are
articulated first, followed by selection of teaching and learning
platforms (subjects and activities) that contribute to students’
achievement of those outcomes, and finally by assessment design:

**3.15.1 Protocol of an OBA-Based Curriculum Design**


.. figure:: ../../media/pics//2017-001.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Figure 3.1
   :figclass: align-center

   Figure 3.1 Protocol of an OBA-Based Curriculum Design

The assumption for such a design — that assessment needs tangible
artifacts to indicate achievement of intended learning outcomes — is
challenged when reflecting on what a college education entails. An
examination of college education reveals three aspects: exposure to a
variety of learning opportunities (college experiences), completion of
learning activities (learning processes), and student-produced end
products for course-based assignments (academic artifacts).
During their time in college, students encounter various opportunities
(public lectures and forums, extra-curricular activities, and on- and
off-campus involvement in organized or self-initiated activities and
community work) through which they learn to understand others and
themselves, make sense of diverse events, and connect experiences
outside the classroom with in-class learning. These college
experiences enrich and enhance education. By academic tradition,
students complete academic activities (curriculum, required practicum,
additional extra-curricular activities, and learning evaluation), which
are recorded as credits and contribute to awarding degrees.

**3.16 QUASI-OBA DESIGN**

To help students acquire disciplinary knowledge, faculty include
program-level learning outcomes whose end products are often tangible
and directly assessable. Other learning outcomes—especially HO-KSs—
produce less-tangible end products and are sometimes not assessed or
only assessed indirectly (e.g., surveys). To strengthen assessment of
a complete college education, an OBA-based curriculum needs a balanced
inclusion of outcomes across the three compositions described earlier.
Assessability of HO-KSs can be enhanced by shifting assessment focus
from solely end products to include the processes and experiences that
lead to those products. With this shift, processes and experiences may
be included as part of intended learning outcomes.

Without altering OBA’s core, the proposed modification expands learning
outcomes for HO-KSs by emphasizing processes that enhance realization
of meta-knowledge and meta-skills:

**3.16.1  Proposed Quasi-OBA-Based Curriculum Design**

.. figure:: ../../media/pics//2017-002.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Figure 3.2
   :figclass: align-center

   Figure 3.2 Proposed Quasi-OBA-Based Curriculum Design


In this modified design, three types of intended learning outcomes
represent both LO-KSs and HO-KSs and provide tangible outcomes for
assessment. Many HO-KSs are embedded in Type II and Type III outcomes,
and their outcomes can be made tangible for assessment by articulating
process- and experience-based learning outcomes within an OBA-based
curriculum.
Two issues require careful consideration when developing program
learning outcomes: type (which HO-KSs to include) and amount
(how many process- and experience-based outcomes to maintain
curricular balance). The proportion depends on program nature and
external expectations. Specialized programs may include more LO-KSs,
whereas comprehensive programs may emphasize more HO-KSs. Different
fields prioritize different competencies (e.g., engineering expects
students to apply disciplinary knowledge to design and problem solving);
these expectations should inform the selection and proportion of
learning outcomes. Faculty should collect stakeholder input, consider
disciplinary features, and balance end-product outcomes with process
and experience-oriented outcomes.
To build consensus on which HO-KSs to prioritize, faculty should gather
input from relevant stakeholders and incorporate it into decision
processes. They must ensure inclusion enhances overall curricular
balance, retaining sufficient end-product outcomes alongside
process-/experience-oriented outcomes. External expectations (e.g., ABET
accreditation) may influence the proportion and nature of outcomes in
certain programs.

**3.17 CONCLUSIONS**

Sharing effective QA practices with peers in other regions is not only
about accepting resources, processes, and outputs but also about gaining
peer recognition of the effectiveness and quality of one’s QA
practice. The description of Hong Kong QA practices provides overseas
peers a clearer understanding of the region’s QA context. Although QA
in Hong Kong has matured in design and implementation, there remains
room for improvement.

Despite progress, the UGC recognizes challenges faced by the sector in a
globalized context. Over the past decade the UGC has conducted studies
and consultations on continuous enhancement strategies. A series of
recommendations were proposed (UGC, 2010) to support enhancement; in
QA, several cautionary considerations remain. One recommendation
(UGC, 2010) — that a single QA body instead of the current three QA
bodies be created to oversee quality in education services offered by
different providers or through different channels (i.e., lifelong
learning) — would be worthwhile for reconsideration. As a
high-stakes enterprise, the proposal, although culturally fit, may too
narrowly concentrate QA power in a single entity. There needs to be a
careful balance between cultural influence in local QA approaches and
accepted practices of diverse QA systems.

A second area for consideration is increasing nonlocal student intake
for Hong Kong’s higher education sector. The portion of
international students weighs heavily on internationalization efforts.
The capacity to host this group is limited by the size of existing
campuses. With Hong Kong’s historical role as a gateway between East
and West, there has been frequent reference to making Hong Kong an
“education hub” (UGC, 2010). The UGC’s current stance appears to
strategize toward this goal by enhancing global competitiveness to
attract economic investment and to utilize growing international
platforms created by mainland China’s expanding economic power. Such
strategic consideration for internationalization will affect how QA
shapes future capacity development. A 26 percent increase during
2010/11–2013/14 in incoming exchange students as part of
internationalization will pose a challenge, since QA for student
learning outcomes of nonlocal students must be integrated into current
QA practice.

The final area for consideration concerns implementing the revised
OBA-based curriculum in Hong Kong’s higher education sector. The
first cohort of graduates from the 3+3+4 curriculum will graduate in
2016. Adjustments will be needed based on evidence from student
learning-outcome assessments and related infrastructural changes.
Judging how fit the OBA approach is for the new curriculum may pose a
challenge.
