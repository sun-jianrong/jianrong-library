出现在句中的AND
=================

*孙 建 荣*

And 这个单词在英语读物中处处可见,显得十分活泼。它虽然只是一个连词,然而不论它是出现在句首还是出现在句中,它所表达的意思是多样的。这里,想就其在句中所表达的意思作一简要的归纳。

**一、表示转折**

The men of Moscow huff and puff, complain, warn, bluster — *and* no one seems to pay any attention.

----When Moscow Growls ... by Joseph Harsch

莫斯科的当家人怒气冲冲,牢骚满腹,又是警告,又是大喊大叫一可是好象谁也不予置理。

"I have it!" Strelzyk suddenly shouted, leaping up and slapping his friend on the back. "We'll go by balloon." Günter looked at him in amazement. "Great, *and* where do we find a balloon?"

----The Great Balloon Escape Reader's Degest, 1980

Strelgyk 突然喊到:"有办法了!"他一下子跳了起来,在他朋友的背上拍了一下,"我们可以乘坐气球逃跑。" Günter 惊奇地望着他说:"太好了,可是哪儿去搞气球呢?"

当 and 在句中出现表示转折时,有时是语气上的转折,有时则表示话题的转变,这时,and 的意思与 but, yet 等词的意思是相近的,这主要从上下文或者前后句子来判断 and 是否含有转折之意。如有,在翻译时,就要把这层意思恰当地表达出来。因为有些作者在可以用 but 或 yet 等词的地方用 and 来代替,是由于 but和 yet 这两个词在表示转折时太明显、太平淡,而用 and 可以给读者留下读后去自己思考的余地,使句子或文章更富有戏剧性。例如:

I've been told many stories about him, *and* I don't believe any of them. We had been in the hat shop for half an hour *and* my wife was still in front of the mirror.

----New Concept English Practice and Progress

The 28-minute flight was over—*and* the families still did not know for certain whether they were safe.

----The Great Balloon Escape Reader's Degest, 1980

以上三个例子中的连词 and,根据句子的语气可以弄出,它是起着 but、yet 的作用,尽管别人告诉我许多有关他的闲话,但我一点也不相信,尽管我们在商店里已经呆了半个多小时,可她还在镜子前站着,28分钟的飞行已经结束了,然而这一家人还不敢断定他们是否到达了安全之地。

**二、表示补充的东西**

In June Moscow wined and dined Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit and offered Soviet arms to Turkey. Mr Ecevit signed a frienship agreement, but declined the arms, *and* went home saying Turkey would remain inside the NATO alliance.

----What Comes of Kremlin Effort?

The Christian Science Monitor, 1978

六月份,莫斯科大摆酒席,招待了土耳其总理埃切维特,并表示要向土耳其提供苏联武器。埃切维特先签署了一项友好协定,但是谢绝了武器,而且回国后说,土耳其将继续留在北约之内。

在这种情况下,and 主要表示几件事发生的先后次序。

**三、表示结果或前面一件等对后面一件事的影响**

Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board *and* the decks were soon covered with colourful rugs from Persia, silk from India, coprer coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silver -ware.

----New Concept English Developing Skills

她(大船)还未停稳,小船的人就已登上了大船,于是,甲板上很快就充满了五颜六色的波斯地毯、印度丝绸、铜咖啡壶,以及手工制作的漂亮的银器。

On March 15 there was a second border clash on Damausky/Chenpao. This time both sides were prepared, *and* casualties were higher.

----The Secret Path To Peking by Henry Kissinger

三月十五日,在珍宝岛上又发生了第二次边界冲突,这一次双方都是作了准备的,因此伤亡人数很多。

当前面的句子已提到了某事,紧接着出现一个由连词 and 连接的另一句子,这时,and 之后的句子表明受到前一事的影响、作用,或者是前一事的结果,这种句子也叫做所谓的 cause-effect sentence,再如

The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged during the war *and* has been silent ever since.

----New Concept English Developing Skills

At the moment, they cover every inch of the floor space *and* I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room.

----New Concept English Practice and Progress

But when they tried to inflate the balloon, it lay limps on the grass, they had bought the wrong material *and* the air escaped through the cotton.

----The Great Balloom Escape Reader's Degest, 1980

在上面例句中,可以看出:大钟不响了是由于它在战争中遭到破坏的缘故,我不得不踩着书走出走进是因为书占据了地板上所有的空地方,空气之所以从棉布中跑掉是由于制做气球的材料布买错了。这就是说,后面的部分都受到前面之事直接影响。

**四、表示对比**

SALI II, Negotiations with the Russians resume in Geneva this month, *and* the two superpowers remain at loggerheads over restrictions on the US Cruise Missile and the Russian Backfire bomber.

----A Host of Issues Confront The President

TIME Weekly

第二阶段限制武器会谈。同俄国人的谈判将于本月在日内瓦恢复,而在限制美国的"巡航导弹"和限制俄国的"逆火式"轰炸机的问题上,两个超级大国仍然争论不休。

He would be a short-sighted commander who merely manned his fortress *and* did not look beyond.

----A Course of English-Chinese Translation

谁知道只守城堡而不往远处看,那他就是一个目光浅短的指挥员。

在句中,如果 and 是用来表示对比的话,我们是可以用but或while来代替的,例如

John is as poor as a church-mouse, *and* (or but) his brother is rolling in wealth.

----A Grammar of Late Modern English PartII P816

约翰一贫如洗,而他的弟弟却腰缠万贯。

Robert is secretive *and* (in contrast) David is candid.

----A Grammar of Contemporary English P 561

罗伯特守口如瓶,而大卫却直言不讳。

**五、表示某种特殊的并列关系**

Two *green-and-white* butterflies fluttered past them...

----The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

两只绿白花色的蝴蝶掠过飞过他们……

But when he reached the house and saw four attendants in *red and black* caps in the doorway holding whips, he was too frightened to go in.

----The Schorlar (《儒林外史》吴敬梓)

到了寓处门口,只见四个戴红白帽子的,手里拿着鞭子,站在门口,吓了一跳,不敢进去。

为了表达这种特殊关系,人们常用 and 这个连词来连接两个名词或两个形容词。如果连接的是两个名词,它所表示的是两者之间的并列关系,如大家所熟悉的 bread *and* butter (夹黄油的面包), a lock *and* key (带钥匙的锁子), a watch *and* chain (带表链的表)等等。最常见的是连接两个形容词,表示某物具有这两个形容词(特别是颜色词)所代表的性质。例

purple *and* gold texture

rermilion-and-gold ceiling

red *and* white striped blouse

rose *and* purple vest lined with brown *and* gray squirred skin

紫黄花色的布,

红黄花色的天花板,

红条白底的西装衬衣,

玫瑰紫二色金银鼠的坎肩儿。

**六、and 在句中出现,起到if + clause的作用**

One more word, *and* I'll kill you.

Another mistake *and* he'll be angry with you.

More complaints, *and* you will earn police detention.

意思就是 If you say one more word; If you make another mistake; If you have more complaints;再如

Give him an inch, *and* he'll take an ell.

所以,and 等于一个以 if 引导的条件从句,通常,and 的前面部分多用祈使句,后部分用表示意愿等的情态动词 will, could 等,而且这部分句子一般多采用一般现在或将来时态,而不太经常用过去时态。

**七、起承上启下的作用一般不用把and 译出来**

I do not mean that one should be without interest in them, but one's interest should be contemplative *and*, if possible, philanthropic, but not unduly emotional.

----How to Grow Old by Bertrand Russel

我不是说一个人不应当关心他们(孩子们),而是说这种关心主要应该是多为他们着想,可能的话,给他们一些忠诚,而不应该过分地动感情。

在句中因为已经出现的某些连词本身就已表明了前后句子的关系时,这时的 and 所起的作用只是使前后两句连接更紧、更自然。例

*(一)和表示时间关系的短语连用*

Yes, I must confess to having been quilty, *malgre moi*, of as much public speaking as most of my contemporaries, *and for the last ten years* it ceased to be so much of a bugbear to me.

----Autoblography by Thomas Henry Huxley

When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled quiltily *and then* put the parcel on the desk.

----New Concept English Practice and Pregress

*(二)和表示因果关系的词连用*

But I do not know, they may see enormities where I see nothing, *and so* perhaps I had better keep the fate of their masterpieces hidden from them.

----At the Tailors by J.B. Priestly

They are at home in these little halls of mirrors, *and so* look well in them from every possible angle of reflection.

---- 同上

I say fortuantely, not from any lack of respect for Tornto, but because I soon made up my mind that London was the place for me, *and hence* I have steadily declined the inducements to leave it, which have at various times been offered.

----Autoblography by Thomas Henry Huxley

*(三)和表示转折的词连用*

Incredible that a man can take such a face and car-case about with him, *and yet* entertain a tolerably good opinion of himself

----Autoblography by Thomas Henry Huxley

Mauberlay is shorter than the others and speaks more directly to the interests of most readers, *and yet* it too is formidably difficult.

----Eira Pound's Huge Selayn Mauberlay

在这些情况下,由于句中已有的连词已经表明了前后句子的关系,所以 and 就不必译出来了。

**八、表示一个同类的内容,这时的and一般不用译出来**

In theory they still owed obedience to their fathers until marriage *and* to their husband's ever after; *and* in practice they had a very subservient position all their lives unless they achieved a prestigious old age by raising at least one son to adulthod.

----Chincse Women before Liberation

Current History U.S.

从理论上说,他们婚前得听命于父亲,婚后得听命于丈夫。从实际情况看,妇女一生都处于屈从的地位,除非至少把一个儿子养大成人而且自己又到了福寿双全的时候,情况才会有所改变。

在句中常常会碰见同时提出几件事,或者几个动作一齐发生时,通常用 and 来连接它们之间的最后一件事或最后一个动作。再如

Wives who tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and versatile. Even husbands who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be electricians, carpenters, plumbers *and* machanics.

----New Concept English Developing Skills

Men of all ages spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying-out their own gardens, building garages *and* making furniture.

---- 同上

以上只是简单地归纳了一下 and 在句中出现时的一些用法及含意,它还有其它一些用法,这里并没有能够将它们一一归纳出来,有时,对出现在句中的 and 还有不同的解释,要弄清它在不同情况下的准确含意,还需进一步的探讨。
